# 2 A.M. THOUGHTS

## Project Overview
"2 A.M. Thoughts" is a web project designed to address the curiosity, doubts, and mental health concerns of young minds and adolescents. This platform aims to provide a safe space where individuals can open their hearts and share their thoughts with others. It features a blogging system UI/UX design created using HTML and CSS. The project includes three main sections: Experience, Let's Talk, and Counseling. The Experience section allows users to share their personal experiences, the Let's Talk section facilitates discussions among users, and the Counseling section, which is currently under development, will provide online guidance and help for those seeking counseling. Additionally, the platform offers a space for psychology interns to kickstart their careers online.

Lack of awareness and understanding about mental health often leads to harmful behaviors and long-term mental and physical issues. There is a significant need for a platform where young people can safely discuss their thoughts, seek guidance, and connect with others who share similar experiences.
